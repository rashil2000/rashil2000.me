# Personal Website

## [rashil2000.me](https://rashil2000.me/)

### A complete content management system for personal blogs and projects

### Key features:

- Implemented using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - *The* React Framework for production.
- Written in pure, functional React JavaScript-XML.
- Uses [LaTeX.css](https://latex.now.sh/), a purely-CSS class-less library for minimalistic design.
- Extremely lightweight - with only 3 dependencies (other than [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [LaTeX.css](https://latex.now.sh/)) - for rendering Markdown content.
- Blazing-fast performance with Server Side Rendering and Incremental Static Generation.

This project scores a **perfect 100** in all four categories - Performance, Accessibilty, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimization - of Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) auditor.

### Functionality

- Authentication for allowing write access.
- Add new blogs and projects, writing them in a Markdown editor.
- Edit current blogs and projects.
- Remove blogs and projects.
- Upload images for serving them in Markdown.

The backend of the site is powered by [api.rashil2000.me](https://api.rashil2000.me/) - another personal project of mine - written in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) using JavaScript, whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/rashil2000/api.rashil2000.me).
